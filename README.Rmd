Tools for working with [Marine Protected Areas](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/our-work/quality-and-effectiveness/world-database-protected-areas-wdpa) to compute species diversity metrics using [OBIS](https://obis.org/) data.

# Installation

```

# Usage


## Polygons for MPAs 

We use the [wdpar](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wdpar) R package to fetch MPAs by country (or 'global' for the complete dataset.)  By default, we store the files you download in the path returned by `rappdirs::user_data_dir("wdpar")` in [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/). Once you have downloaded format you can simply read the file from disk using `read_mpa()`.

```{r fetch_country, message = FALSE}
library(rappdirs)
library(sf)
library(mpatools)
x <- fetch_mpa(name = 'Cuba')
# or if you already have the data
# x <- read_mpa(name = "Cuba")
plot(sf::st_geometry(x))
```

## OBIS occurrence data

We use the [robis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/robis/index.html) R package to fetch occurrence data.  By default we store files you downlaod in the path returned by `rappdirs::user_data_dir("robis")` in [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/). Once you have downloaded format you can simply read the file from disk using `read_obis()`. 

```{r fetch_obis}
obis <- fetch_obis(x) %>%
        write_obis("Cuba", overwrite = TRUE)
```
